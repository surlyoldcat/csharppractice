This is a Visual Studio 2017 solution, created with .Net 4.6.1.
Projects:
GFBD.Arr- problem 1 in BDCodeSamples. Build & run the exe or start in debug, the console app will prompt for input.

GFBD.Scripper- problem 2 in BDCodeSamples. Build & run (or debug) and it will execute a series of test cases. Otherwise, ObjectScripper.cs is the "API" for this problem, and ScipperTests.cs is the test runner.

GFBD.Scripper depends on the widely used Newtonsoft.Json NuGet package.
